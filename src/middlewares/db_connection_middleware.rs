// db_connection_middleware.rs
// This file was intentionally reduced to a no-op placeholder. The project no longer
// injects per-request DB connections into request extensions. Handlers and
// middleware should acquire connections directly from the pool via `pool.get()`.

// Keeping this placeholder avoids accidental breakage from stale build artifacts
// while clearly signaling the module's removal.

// No public symbols exported here by design.
